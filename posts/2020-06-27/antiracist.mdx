I am currently reading **How To Be an Antiracists** by __Ibram X. Kendi__. It is a great book if you want to learn about institutional racism and how to confront it. One of main points of the book is that there are only 2 definitions - racist or antiracists. If you are just "not a racist", you are a racist. This is because this implies inaction - you're not part or the problem so you don't need to be part of the solution.

I am a white christian male. This simple distinction means that I have opportunities that many others don't. But, I have always considered myself as not racist. I believe in individuals, and try to not let what I think as irrelevant distinctions of race, religion, sex, or sexual preference not be part of my perception. But it's not always easy and I often fail. Through my years, I have strayed off this path, and I probably always will. But I still think it's important to try to come back to these ideals.

I currently live in New Zealand. This country is much less racist than other places I have been, but it's far from ideal. While the United States is known for being very racist, it's much more honest about it. Confederate flags, KKK, voting regulations, healthcare and so on make it undeniable. But here, racism is still prevelant. It's just more polite.

What is the difference? As a white male, if I was having a conversation with another white male in North America, the other white male might say to me within earshot of a minority what a scourge a minority is. In New Zealand, they will still say that to me, but only in private. It's less socially acceptable here.

One of the things I find funny is how some white Kiwis will explain my lack of racism. The reason (in their minds) for why I don't see other races and cultures as inferior is because I grew up in a place that was only white. In the city I lived between the ages of 1 to 27, the 2016 census listed the population of "visible minorities" as less than 5%. That means that 95% is caucasian. So, they reason, I am not racist because it don't know "them".

But I think that is the reason I tend towards antiracist. In a population where everyone is white, you find other reasons for one group to feel superior to another. I grew up being told that "we are better" because of the language we speak (40% of the city spoke french), religious affiliation (we are the true followers of Jesus, all other "christians" were against God because they were doing it wrong, and non christians are even worse), neighbourhood, economic status, hair colour (as a redhead, some saw me as a true son of our superior forefathers, others as genetically inferior), even something as insignificant as your family name. And, of course, we had racists. I was always confused by the white supremacist in my hometown because they rarely encountered non-whites. It is very hard to argue that we need to protect what's rightfully ours when there's no one trying to take it from us.

When I ask what reasons "they" are inferior to "us", all the reasons given I have seen manifested in more white people than all other races or cultures combined. These include:
    
* Perception of low intelligence. (I have known many intelligent people who score low on traditional methods of measurement, such as academic achievement or IQ.)
* Economic status
* Lack of initiative (will take handouts and not try to "achieve greatness")
* Lie, cheat and steal
* Addiction
* Drug dealing
* Domestic violence
* Violent crime

I also saw that if you are one of "them", policies and behaviours will be encouraged to keep you where you belong. If you try to be something you're not supposed to be, you end up fighting both the privileged and underprivileged groups. The privileged will tell you to know your place. The underprivileged will tell you that you think you're better than them, refusing any support or encouragement.

So you stay in your box, further enforcing the belief in the superiority/inferiority scale.

In my life, I faced struggles. I thought differently, so I was uneducated. Any attempt to educate me into normal failed. So I was stupid. My family struggled financially. Both my parents had full time jobs to be able to pay the bills. Through their hard work, they were able to own their own house. We always had food on the table. But when I graduated high school, I couldn't go to university. There was no money for tuition. So I ended up taking low paying jobs (usually minimum wage) for 9 years and failing all attempts of improvement. I struggled with drug use and depression. I thought I would never be happy. I participated in illegal activities. I felt stupid and hopeless. 

It was pure chance that I was introduced to basic computer programming by my room mate. If that didn't happen, I don't know where I would be. I found that I "got it" and encouraged me to quit my low paying dead-end job and go back to school at 27 years old. It was really hard emotionally and financially.

But, 20 years later I am comfortable. I can provide for the ones I love, and give them opportunities (if they want them) I didn't have. I can pay the bills, and even put money aside for the future. We don't have to compromise our budget. I can help others.

After thinking about this for years, I am finally taking action. I will not be embarrassed to talk against inequality just because I'm white. I will look for opportunities in my community to encourage and support individuals who want to break the norms. I want to nurture inner confidence that so that anyone can achieve their dreams, and let those dreams be anything they want. If you want to be a lawyer, doctor, engineer, artist or scientist, don't let society tell you that you can't. But if you even if you don't, that's perfectly fine too. Work in a factory. Work in a drivethru. Be a stay at home parent. Be unemployed. But be the best you you can be. What's important is you are happy, and it was your unbiased choice. Don't let anyone else tell you what you should be.

Join with me. Let's change the system. If, like me, you are part of the privileged majority, it doesn't mean you shouldn't fight the system that rewards you. Look for ways to help others. See people as they really are as an individual. Don't make assumptions. Don't force your ideals of success on others. Fight hate and anger with love and respect.
